**Date:** July 28, 2025

DetailLogger is a lightweight Python utility for enhanced logging and exception tracing. It automatically captures contextual information—such as file name, function, and line number—whenever messages or exceptions are logged. Ideal for debugging, monitoring, and building maintainable systems.

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlapine/detaillogger.git
cd detaillogger
```

No external dependencies are required.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Logs messages with caller context  
- ✅ Captures exceptions with full traceback  
- ✅ Supports console and file-based logging  
- ✅ Uses wrapper functions for quick integration

```python
from detaillogger import log, log_exception

log("This is a message to log.")

try:
    x = 1 / 0
except Exception as e:
    log_exception(e, details="Divide-by-zero detected")
```

**Console Output:**

```
