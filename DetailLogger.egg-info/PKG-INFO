## ✨ Overview

DetailLogger is a lightweight Python utility for enhanced logging and exception tracing. It automatically captures contextual information—such as file name, function, and line number—whenever messages or exceptions are logged. Ideal for debugging, monitoring, and building maintainable systems.

---

## 📦 Installation

`pip install detaillogger`

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Logs messages with caller context  
- ✅ Captures exceptions with full traceback  
- ✅ Supports console and file-based logging  
- ✅ Uses wrapper functions for quick integration  
- ✅ Built entirely on standard libraries

---

## ✍️ API Overview

- `DetailLogger(level, fmt, file_name)`: Create an instance with optional file output and log level  
- `log(message: str)`: Logs message with caller metadata  
- `log_exception(ex: BaseException, details: Optional[str])`: Logs exception type, message, optional details, and source context
