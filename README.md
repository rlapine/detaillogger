## ✨ Overview

DetailLogger is a lightweight Python utility for enhanced logging and exception data tracing. It automatically captures contextual information—such as file name, function, and line number—whenever messages or exceptions are logged. The clear and complete exception information is very useful for debugging, monitoring, and building maintainable systems.

---

## 📦 Installation

`pip install detaillogger`

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Logs messages with caller context  
- ✅ Captures exceptions with full traceback and information  
- ✅ Supports console and file-based logging  
- ✅ Built entirely on standard libraries

---

## ✍️ API Overview

- `DetailLogger(level, fmt, file_name)`: Create an instance with optional file output and log level  
- `log(message: str)`: Logs message with caller metadata  
- `log_exception(ex: BaseException, details: Optional[str])`: Logs exception type, message, optional details, and source context

---
